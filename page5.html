                <p>
                    I play a lot of different games that I think are amazing. Recently
                    I've been playing a game called Final Fantasy XIII. I'm trying to get
                    all of the acheivements in the game and I'm currently more than half 
                    way there. Other games I've been playing recently include Dead By 
                    Daylight, Lethal Company, and an idle game on my phone that I don't
                    remember the name of. Lethal Company is a game that is best when 
                    playing with others but I've been playing by myself just trying to get 
                    better at it. Dead By Daylight is a multiplayer game that once again 
                    I'm trying to get better at. Some other games I play but not as often
                    as the games I named earlier are Chess and a game on my phone called 
                    Grimoire which is just another Idle game.
