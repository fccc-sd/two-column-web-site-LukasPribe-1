        <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I was born on August, 4th 2006 in Toledo. I lived in Metamora and 
                went to <em>Evergreen Elementary School</em> until 5th grade. I 
                moved to <em>Delta</em> in 6th grade and have lived there since. 
                I'm the second child of my parents who have four kids. We have a 
                pet dog named Kahmari. I like to keep my room organized in a 
                way were I know were everything is but it might look messy to 
                everyone else. I have a PS5, a Nintendo switch, a TV, and a laptop. 
                I used to also be in band at Delta before I came to Four County.
            </p>

        <h3>Game Systems</h3>
            <p>
                I have a lot of game systems but not all of them are used anymore. 
                I have a Play Station 3, a Play Station 4, and a Play Station 5, 
                I also have a Wii, a Nintendo Switch, and a Nintendo 3DS. I used 
                to have a Nintendo DS but it broke when it got hit by a ball. We 
                also had a Super Nintendo Entertainment System and a Nintendo 
                64 but my brother has those now. The system that had the best games 
                would probably be the Play Station 3 and the Nintendo 64 since those 
                had my first Final Fantasy and The Legend of Zelda games. 
            </p>
    
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                My hobbies include collecting pokémon cards, Playing both video 
                and board games, collecting rocks and sorting my pokémon cards 
                when i'm bored. I have easily over 700 different pokémon cards and 
                over 1000 total pokémon cards. If one day I decide to sell all my 
                pokemon cards I could get well over $400 dollars. I also like to play 
                video Games like <span class="gameNames">The Legend of Zelda, 
                Final Fantasy, Pokémon, Empires of the Undergrowth, and Minecraft
                </span>. My favorite Board games are <span class="gameNames">Battleship,
                Clue, Chess, Backgammon, and Uno. </span>
